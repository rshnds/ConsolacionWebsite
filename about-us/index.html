                    <h1>The Gateway to the North</h1>
                    <p>Nestled between the vibrant urban hubs of Cebu City and Mandaue, the Municipality of Consolacion offers a serene retreat just minutes away from the bustling metropolis.</p>

                    <h3>From Kampi-ig to Consolacion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once a quiet barrio called Kampi-ig, Consolacion has grown into a bustling municipality with a story of resilience.
                    </p>

                    <p>Originally part of Mandaue, it became an independent town in 1871, only to face challenges that led to its 
                        reintegration with Mandaue in the early 1900s.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through determination, the people petitioned for independence, and in 1920, Consolacion was reborn as a 
                        municipality. It was named in honor of the governor’s daughter.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Cultural Pride</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every February 14, Consolacion bursts into life with the Sarok Festival, a vibrant homage to its agricultural roots. 
                        The festival celebrates the Sarok, an eco-friendly bamboo-and-banana-leaf hat once worn by farmers to shield themselves. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From colorful street dancing to intricately designed Sarok hats, the festival is a testament to the town’s creative spirit 
                        and cultural heritage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consolacion is also home to the Miligoy de Cebu, a traditional courtship dance performed with bamboo castanets.
